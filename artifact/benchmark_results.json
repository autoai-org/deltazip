Alan Turing was a pioneer whose work helped establish computers as a viable alternative to humans typing on a keyboard. His groundbreaking work, called the Turing Test Protocol (\u201cTP\u201d), consisted of several components (\u201cTP-protocol\u201d), namely the Turing Test (\u201cTD\u201d), the Turing Test for a computer (\u201cTC\u201d), Pingback: Alan Turing: Birth, Life, and Legacy (\u201cAL\u201d) \u2026.
