Recently the top management team has decided to implement a MES(Manufacturing Execution System) software solution to vastly enhance its production line efficiency and reduce production leadtime.  The supplier of this MES software solution is called Quick Link. \nIssue 3: Your team member from production department is very key for the success of the project.  He needs to coordinate the requirement collections, facilitate hardware/software installation and testing etc.  However, he is also a busy person and has limited time with your project.
