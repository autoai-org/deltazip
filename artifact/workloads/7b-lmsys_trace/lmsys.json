The mother is suffocating and allows him to do what he wants. He eats what he wants, and studies what he wants,\" he added.   \n\nAuthorities began investigating when the teenager was admitted to hospital in Rennes last July weighing only 25 kilograms, around half the norm for his age, and showing severe learning difficulties, the Ouest France newspaper reported.\n\nLudot said he weighed 33 kilograms when he was taken into state care.\n\n\"We were happy. Now we're both unhappy,\" the woman told the BFM news channel in an interview.\n\n\"I've been doing the best for my son from the beginning. Both by opening the world to him according to his age and protecting him.\"\n\nHis mother denied he had \"ever gone to bed hungry\" and said she allowed him to leave the home for cultural activities such as going to the library.\n\nHomeschooling is only allowed in specific circumstances in France.\n\nParents can ask for permission to homeschool - for example for health reasons or a disability - but must agree to regular inspections from local education authorities. \nASSISTANT: ",

Memory has been a\nrecurrent theme in neural network research, dating back to early works (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943;\nStephen, 1956) and significantly advancing in the 1990s with the introduction of the Backpropagation\nThrough Time learning algorithm (Werbos, 1990) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural\narchitecture (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Contemporary memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) typically utilize some form of recurrent external memory separate from the model\u2019s\nparameters. Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) (Graves et al., 2014) and Memory Networks (Weston\net al., 2015) are equipped with storage for vector representations accessible through an attention\nmechanism. Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) were designed to\nenable reasoning through sequential attention over memory content.\nNTMs, followed by Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) and Sparse DNC\n(Rae et al., 2016), are implemented as recurrent neural networks capable of writing to memory\nstorage over time. All these models are differentiable and trainable via backpropagation through\ntime (BPTT). Parallel research lines extend recurrent neural networks, such as LSTM, with data\nstructures like stacks, lists, or queues (Joulin and Mikolov, 2015; Grefenstette et al., 2015).
